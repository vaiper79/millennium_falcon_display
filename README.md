# millennium_falcon_display

These are the files used to develop and control the audio/lighting circuit I will use on my Bandai Millennium Falcon scale model.

The files should be fairly selfexplanatory in their naming, i.e. "soundtest.ino" was/is used to test all the sound pins on the audio card. 

Disclaimer: 
I am NOT a professional programmer. There WILL be bugs and weird mistakes. I try to remove them when I find them, but I cannot guarantee that all my solutions used in the code are good/best practice solutions.Also, pretty sure this wont destroy your hardware if you try it for yourself, but obviously I take no responsibility if you decide to use my code. 

You have been warned :) 

Also, feel free to copy/modify and use this piece of code if you find it useful. As thanks you could always follow my blog (https://oleandre.net) and/or Instagram (@oleshobbyblog).
